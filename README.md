# 📧 Email Triage OpenEnv

A real-world **email triage environment** for training and evaluating AI agents on the daily workflow of a customer support or operations professional.

## 🌍 Environment Description & Motivation

Every business runs on email. Triaging an inbox — classifying by priority, routing to the right team, replying appropriately, catching spam, and escalating crises — is a high-value cognitive task that humans do daily, yet is tedious and error-prone.

This environment places an AI agent in the role of a **customer support agent** processing a realistic inbox. The agent must:
- **Read** emails (using the `focus` action)
- **Classify** each by urgency and category
- **Reply** with the correct tone to customer queries
- **Escalate** critical issues to the right team (billing, legal, engineering, management)
- **Flag spam** accurately — including distinguishing phishing from legitimate security alerts (the hard task's key trap)
- **Avoid loops** and unnecessary actions

This is a genuinely useful domain for agent training: a strong performing agent here would have real-world deployment value.

## ⚡ Action Space

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `focus` | `email_id` | Read an email (sets `current_email`) |
| `classify` | `priority`, `category` | Label email by urgency + type |
| `reply` | `body`, `tone` | Send a reply with tone: formal/friendly/apologetic/escalating |
| `escalate` | `escalate_to`, `note` | Route to: manager/legal/technical_team/billing_team |
| `flag_spam` | `confidence` | Mark as spam (penalizes false positives heavily) |
| `archive` | `reason` | Archive: resolved/irrelevant/spam |
| `mark_read` | — | Mark as read |
| `snooze` | `duration_hours` | Snooze for later |
| `noop` | — | Do nothing (small penalty) |

**Action format** (JSON POSTed to `/step`):
```json
{"action_type": "classify", "priority": "urgent", "category": "technical"}
{"action_type": "reply", "body": "We're on it!", "tone": "apologetic"}
{"action_type": "escalate", "escalate_to": "billing_team", "note": "Double charge"}
{"action_type": "focus", "email_id": "t1_e3"}
{"action_type": "flag_spam", "confidence": 0.97}
```

## 📋 Tasks

### Task 1 — Basic Inbox Triage *(Easy)*
- **Inbox size:** 10 emails
- **Max steps:** 30
- **Objective:** Focus and classify every email by `priority` + `category`
- **Grader:** Classification accuracy — percentage of (priority, category) pairs correct
- **Expected score range:** 0.4 – 0.9 for a capable LLM
- **Key challenge:** Distinguishing urgent vs. high vs. normal priority from email tone

### Task 2 — Reply and Escalate Critical Issues *(Medium)*
- **Inbox size:** 15 emails (superset of Task 1)
- **Max steps:** 50
- **Objective:** Classify all, reply to customer queries with appropriate tone, escalate critical issues, flag/archive spam
- **Grader:** Weighted composite — classification (40%), reply quality (30%), escalation routing (20%), spam detection (10%)
- **Expected score range:** 0.3 – 0.75
- **Key challenge:** Identifying the correct escalation target and reply tone for time-sensitive emails

### Task 3 — Full Customer Support Workflow *(Hard)*
- **Inbox size:** 20 emails (superset of Task 2)
- **Max steps:** 80
- **Objective:** All of Task 2, plus handling **traps** and **thread continuity**
- **Grader:** Task 2 scoring (70%) + trap handling (15%) + thread continuity (10%) + multi-action completeness (5%)
- **Expected score range:** 0.2 – 0.65
- **Key traps:**
  - `t3_e16`: A **legitimate security alert** from `security-noreply@ourcompany-platform.com` — flagging this as spam is a **hard penalty (-0.30)**
  - `t3_e17`: A **phishing email** disguised as an internal IT message from a `.ru` domain — must be correctly flagged
  - `t3_e18`: A **follow-up thread** to an earlier billing dispute — requires escalation AND reply
  - `t3_e20`: A **server outage** requiring escalation to BOTH `technical_team` AND `manager`

## 🏆 Reward Function

Rewards are shaped to provide signal throughout the episode (not just at the end):

| Event | Reward |
|-------|--------|
| Correct priority classification | +0.10 |
| Correct category classification | +0.10 |
| Correct reply tone | +0.08 |
| Non-trivial reply body | +0.04 |
| Correct escalation team | +0.12 |
| True positive spam flag | +0.10 |
| Correct archive of spam/resolved | +0.05 |
| Focus action (reads email) | +0.01 |
| **False positive spam flag** | **-0.20** |
| Wrong classification | -0.02 |
| Unnecessary escalation | -0.10 |
| Replying to spam | -0.15 |
| Premature archive (active email) | -0.05 |
| Loop penalty (>3 same action) | -0.15/repeat |
| Noop | -0.01 |

All rewards are clipped to `[-1.0, 1.0]`.
